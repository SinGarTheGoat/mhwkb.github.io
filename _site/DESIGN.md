# CSS and html design

We use Bootstrap, and also a
[local style.css](https://github.com/mhwkb/mhwkb.github.io/blob/master/jekyll/assets/css/style.css) that can be used and edited.

If you haven't ever used Bootstrap or any CSS framework -
* [Boostrap css](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/)
* [w3schools: Bootstrap Intro](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_get_started.asp)
