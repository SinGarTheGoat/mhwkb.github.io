# FAQ

## Q: How often is the web site updated?**

A: There is no set schedule yet, but that may change. Right now I'll say
every 1 - 3 days.

When new posts are added, or html code is changed, the actual web site
does not get automatically updated. We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
to manually generate the site, then copy the static pages to the server.
The more frequently posts get added or code gets changed, the more
frequently the web site will be updated.

After the design of the site is completed, the frequency of site updates
will decrease. It's hard to say for sure, but as I see it now, the schedule
would be something like this:

Updates would happen:

* Once or twice a week if 10 or fewer posts were submitted within a one-week
time period
* Daily if 5 or more posts were submitted within a 24-hour time period
* Immediately if there was a change in design or functionality of the site

(At some point, we'll write a small script to automate the build and update
process)

## **Q: Why do you manually update**

A: During testing, some of the Jekyll plugins worked perfectly when running
Jekyll locally but they did not function as intended on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## **Q: While, I'm probably not really knowledgeable enough to contribute much
if anything to your github project, What else or how else could others
maybe help with it? (apart from code or content)**

*A:* General feedback from a user's perspective. And for those who
don't have time to edit the .md files and submit pull requests: links can be suggested
[using tickets](https://github.com/mhwkb/mhwkb.github.io/issues/new?title=Link%20suggestion%20-).

Anyone is also welcome to join the [chat in the Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/mhwkb/shared_invite/enQtMjU3MjcwMTk4NjYzLTA0ZDc2YjAwMDJiNTU1YTBmYTViNmQ5MTdjOTk2MDA2MDMyMzNiYjU4ZWIzMTZlNmU4ZjFhNDg1MjQ5OGQyMjI).
There are different channels set up for development, help using git,
#random for any type of chat, and a #music channel. People can
participate in the chat, or observe how things are done, the process
for developing a project.

There's a channel to suggest links for the KB, or discuss if links
aren't suitable. For instance, if they are too indirectly related to
mental health, or have too much advertising.

So far there haven't been any substantial discussions about the content
of the links in the KB, no arguments or philosophical debates. And
that's how I think this project would best operate. People of course
have strong views on this subject; and for some it's more personal than
others. And there's a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mhwkb/mhwkb.github.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to help make things especially clear.

And of course, every project needs document editors. :)
