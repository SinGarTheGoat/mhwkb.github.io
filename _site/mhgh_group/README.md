# Mental Health GitHub Group

[Main Group Site](https://github.com/mhwkb)

## History
I originally created the mhwkb GitHub organization so I would have access
to the mhwkb.github.io web address.

(Note: see [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for general information regarding web sites hosted by GitHub)

## Evolution
Late one night, I realized I could list other mental health projects on
the [group page](https://github.com/mhwkb) by forking them.

## Realization
Once I listed a few, I realized that it may be a good way to help other mental
health projects gain more visibility.

## Further Evolution
I started inviting people.

## The Present (a.k.a. About)
I do not contribute to every project listed on the group page. The
maintainers of the projects have no affiliation with me or the projects I own,
nor do they necessarily endorse or contribute to any of the projects I maintain.
I sometimes sync with the repos owned by other project maintainers, and as a result,
the fork moves to the top of the group page.

There are no requirements to be a member. If you would like to request an
invitation to join, please use this link:<br />
[https://github.com/orgs/mhwkb/teams/mental-health-github-group](https://github.com/orgs/mhwkb/teams/mental-health-github-group)<br />
or my [contact information](https://github.com/mhwkb/mhwkb.github.io#contact).

The group page is a statement and a show of support. If it helps
attract contributors or end-users to my project, or to the other projects
listed, then I believe it serves a worthwhile purpose.

If you are a member, it is suggested that in your [group settings](https://github.com/orgs/mhwkb/people), to make your membership
public (it's private by default). That means you will show up on the group page as
a member, and the group avatar and link will appear on your profile.

Additionally, you can allow for discussion using GitHub's "team" feature. Simply navigate to [https://github.com/orgs/mhwkb/teams/mental-health-github-group](https://github.com/orgs/mhwkb/teams/mental-health-github-group) and request membership.

If you would like your mental health project forked to the group, please
send me the GitHub project URL. If you would like my fork of your project
removed, please let me know.
