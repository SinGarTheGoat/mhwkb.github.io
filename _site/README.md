## Goals
* [increase awareness](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21689&LangID=E)
* Web site should be low-maintenance
  * no logins necessary, all changes to site will be submitted through the
  GitHub project page, but feedback and link suggestions and be sent by email
  and through a form on the web site.
  * links to external web sites added should have relatively fast load times,
  not be bogged down fetching hotlinked images, etc.
* To accumulate a wide variety of links related to mental health and wellness
* To present information that is not well-advertised by well-known media outlets
* To provide people with
  * more information
  * more choices
  * more freedom to choose how they would like to pursue their recovery goals
  * the potential for a more open discussion related to how the mental health
  care system could be improved

### Do we need a mailing list for updates?
I think our
[Slack chat workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/mhwkb/shared_invite/enQtMjU3MjcwMTk4NjYzLTA0ZDc2YjAwMDJiNTU1YTBmYTViNmQ5MTdjOTk2MDA2MDMyMzNiYjU4ZWIzMTZlNmU4ZjFhNDg1MjQ5OGQyMjI)
is a good alternative. A user can join and leave at anytime, and will get
notified by email if there are any global announcements or if they are
@pinged.

When I use the _@channel_ command in chat, that notifies everyone (unless
a user has turned that setting off). I don't use _@channel_ very often, so
email traffic from the workspace will be kept low.

But I'm open to feedback about whether or not an email list is desired.

## Warning About Discontinuing Medication
Please note: doctors recommend that no one should attempt to withdrawal
from psychiatric drugs (Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety drugs
and ADHD drugs) without a doctor's supervision. If you have firmly decided to
discontinue medication without a doctor's supervision, you can find some guides
to medication withdrawal (a.k.a. [_discontinuation syndrome_](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-discontinuation-syndrome/)) on book-selling sites, or sites such as [The Icarus Project](http://theicarusproject.net/).

## About Andy Alt (Project Owner)
I first received treatment for mental health issues (major depression, anxiety,
PTSD) in 1991 (age 18). As a patient, I have seen numerous psychiatrists and
psychotherapists, and have been prescribed (and used) many types of psychiatric
medication. I have read many opinions on the subject of mental health, and the
negative and positive experiences consumers have had while using the mental
health care system. I have also read information written by journalists and
doctors. I have no formal education in biology, medicine, psychiatry, or
psychology.

In 1981, when I was eight years old, my father committed suicide. In 2005, I wrote
[_Damned Tears_](http://ifyouregoingthoughhellkeepgoing.blogspot.com/2009/01/friend-writes-of-his-fathers-suicide.html)
during a healing episode. Many people have told me how much they like it and one father
even told me it reminded him to stay alive for his children. I sometimes have posted
in places where suicide prevention is discussed.
